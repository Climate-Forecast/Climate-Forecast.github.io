# Contributing to the netCDF-CF Conventions website

Dear CF community member,

Thank you for taking the time to consider making a contribution to the [website of the cf-conventions](cf-website).

This set of guidelines provides an overview of the process for making changes to the website.

## Correcting errors
Raise an issue describing the error.
Consider associating that issue to a pull request that corrects the error.
A member of the [CF Information Management and Support Team](info-mgmt) will review the change and merge it, deploying it to the website.

## Making improvements
Raise an issue describing what you'd like to do.
A member of the [CF Information Management and Support Team](info-mgmt) will review it and decide how to approach the change.
Generally, items on the website affect the governance of CF and therefore require the approval of 2 members of the [Governance Panel](gov-panel) before merging.
However, minor changes of a technical nature may be implemented upon approval of a member of the [CF Information Management and Support Team](info-mgmt).
